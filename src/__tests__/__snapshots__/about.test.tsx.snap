            burtware is the nickname I've used for my personal 'playgrounds' online since 1999, when I first cut my teeth in 
            <code>
              html
            </code>
             
            & 
            <code>
              design
            </code>
            . Since then I've gone through a number of different efforts.

            <code>
              AWS
            </code>
            . It is a site for me to play with and learn more about 
            <code>
              ReactJS

             and

            When not working or ferrying my kids to one of their many clubs, I like to tinker with code / websites; listen to 'rubbish' music; watch weird and wonderful stuff on various streaming services. I occassionaly make it along to see Motherwell FC too and have been know to strum a tune on the guitar once in a blue moon.
